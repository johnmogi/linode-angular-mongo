1. tablet signage:
the options are as follows:
a. (not recommended)- using a form with cf7 signature add on.
not recommended because i've never worked with it- didn't test it with an ipad etc.
b. gravity form signature add on (costs around 300$ - too expansive)
c. a third party signature service (that'll enable multiple signs and export/ save image)
d. my recommendation: locate a pdf signing software to be used internally- the tablet saves to the cloud.
(easiest - cost  effective stable solution)

2. landing pages status:
a. landing pages infrastructure -working and ready for materials.
b. needs to recieve complete content - both mobile and desktop versions -
either from co-ops such as Sagi or to send the transcripts for me to compile
(approx. 4 hours.)
c. devise a new plan for a new IT to build a LP from react
(building independant server + )
